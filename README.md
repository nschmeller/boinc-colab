# boinc-colab

Open `boinc_template.ipynb` in Colab, input your account info for your favorite BOINC project, and start crunching!

Issues: session will time out after a while, and Colab GPU is not being utilized (even when hardware acceleration is turned on!)

Can also be ran on any Jupyter Notebook platform with minimal changes
